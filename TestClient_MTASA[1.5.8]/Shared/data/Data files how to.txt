Just modifying:
--------------
1. Check this directory out of the svn
2. Change the files in 'MTA San Andreas' as you want
3. If you changed the directory tree layout, update the installer script to reflect this, or ask your mom to do it for you
4. Commit back to the svn

Making installer:
----------------
1. Check this directory out of the svn
2. Update BUILD_NUMBER in 'data files installer.nsi'
3. Run the script (with NSIS 2)
4. Commit back to the svn
5. Upload data_files.exe to somewhere


Note: Uses the same NSIS plugins as the main installer.
