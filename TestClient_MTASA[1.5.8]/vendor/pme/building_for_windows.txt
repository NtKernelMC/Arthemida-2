Building PME for Visual Studio 6.0

PCRE

Regular expressions library

http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/pcre.htm -- you want "developer files"



PME

Windows - grab the latest version. There will be a vs6 directory. Open this in visual studio. Go into project->settings, hit the C/C++ tab, Category: preprocessor, and add/change the directory in "Additional include paths" to the PCRE include file - likely c:\program files\gnuwin32\include. Build it.
