This isn't really done yet.

EHS is distributed under version 2.1 of the LGPL as described in COPYING.

Check out INSTALL for installation notes.

check out ehs_development_guide.txt for how to develop using EHS.

check out building_for_windows.txt to see how to build for Visual Studio 6 (and
probably a decent idea for how to do it for newer versions)
