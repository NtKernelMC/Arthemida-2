CEGUI is embedding a copy of PCRE into itself via its own build system(s).

The version of PCRE included here has been modified from the original
distribution; the original UNIX build system has been removed, pcre.h has been
pre-created from (removed file) pcre.in, and pcreconfig.h has been pre-created
and edited from (removed file) config.h.in.  Additionally, various other test
data, documentation, and source for utilities have been removed.

For details about where to obtain the official releases of PCRE, please see the
README file in this directory.
